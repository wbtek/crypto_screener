//! # WBTek Crypto Screener Application Modules
//!
//! This file defines the main structure of the WBTek Crypto Screener application by organizing 
//! and exposing various modules that handle different aspects of the app's functionality.
//!
//! ## Module Overview
//!
//! - `component`: Contains the primary `Model` component, managing the applicationâ€™s main state and UI.
//! - `about`: Defines the "About" modal view, providing information about the application and its usage.
//! - `button`: Implements the `HeaderButton` component, used for sortable table headers.
//! - `cryptodata`: Defines the `CryptoData` struct, which models cryptocurrency data fetched from an external API.
//! - `headview`: Provides functionality for rendering the table header, including sorting interactions.
//! - `fetch`: Contains functions for fetching data from the cryptocurrency API.
//! - `implmodel`: Adds additional methods and utilities to the main `Model` component.
//! - `message`: Defines messages (`Msg`) used to manage application state updates and user interactions.
//! - `rowview`: Handles the rendering of rows within the cryptocurrency data table.
//! - `sort`: Provides utilities for sorting data based on various criteria.
//! - `utils`: Contains miscellaneous utility functions used throughout the application.
//!
//! Each module focuses on a specific part of the application's functionality, promoting organized
//! and maintainable code structure. Together, they build a comprehensive interface for interacting
//! with cryptocurrency data in a Yew application.
